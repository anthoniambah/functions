1. Javascript Array Methods:

- There are different array methods:

* .length: returns the length (size) of an array.
* .toString(): converts an array to a string (separates the values with a comma)
* .pop(): removes the last element in an array.
* .push(): adds a new element to the end of an array.
* .shift(): just like the .pop(), this removes the first element in an array, and moves the other elements down to the beginning.
* .unshift(): just like the .push(), this adds a new element to the beginning of the array, and pushes the other elements back.
* .join(): joins all the elements in the array to a string. It works just like the .toString(), but in this case, you can specify the separator you want.
* .delete(): as the name implies, it deletes the elements of an array, but leaves "undefined" in the array. It is advised to use .pop() or .shift() instead.
* .concat(): merges two array together and returns a new array of the merged elements. It could also work like the .push(), taking one element (as a string).
* .flat(): creates a new array with sub-array elements concatenated to a specified depth.
* .splice(): adds new elements to an array. The difference between this and .push() or .unshift() is that you can specify the position you want the element to fill.
* .slice(): creates a new array, slicing out a part of the array, into the new array.

- Array Index: this are numbers given to the elements in an array, starting from 0. The elements can be accessed using their index numbers.

2. Javascript Functions: A javascript function is a block of code that performs a particular task. You have the "function" keyword first, followed by a "name" and then the parentheses (). The function name can
